Reasoning from first principles involves breaking down complex problems into their most basic components and building your understanding from scratch. This method contrasts with reasoning by analogy, where you rely on existing knowledge or comparisons with similar situations to understand a problem. To reason from first principles and recognize when you're thinking by analogy, follow these steps:

Identify when you're using analogies: Pay attention to your thought process and recognize when you're making comparisons or using phrases like "it's like...", "it's similar to...", or "it reminds me of...". These are often indicators that you're using analogies to understand a situation.

Break down the problem: When faced with a problem or situation, break it down into its most basic components or underlying principles. Ask yourself questions like "What are the fundamental elements of this problem?" or "What do I know to be absolutely true about this situation?"

Challenge assumptions: Identify any assumptions you're making and question their validity. Consider alternative perspectives or viewpoints, and don't be afraid to challenge conventional wisdom.

Build from the ground up: Once you have a solid understanding of the basic components and have challenged your assumptions, start building your understanding of the problem. Use logic and evidence to create a new framework for understanding the situation, rather than relying on past experiences or comparisons.

Test your reasoning: As you build your understanding, continually test your reasoning by seeking out evidence, asking for feedback, or trying to poke holes in your logic. This process will help ensure that your first-principles reasoning is sound and well-founded.

Refine and iterate: As you gather more information and evidence, refine your understanding and adjust your approach as needed. First-principles reasoning is an ongoing process of learning and adaptation.

Be patient and persistent: Reasoning from first principles can be more time-consuming and challenging than relying on analogies. Be prepared to invest time and effort in understanding a problem at a deeper level, and don't be discouraged by initial difficulties or setbacks.
