> 1 / 1

Here are some technical questions that could challenge Elias Bouassaba, given his diverse background and skill set:

1.  In a microservices architecture, how would you handle data consistency across different services, given that each service may have its own data store?
    
2.  Can you describe the differences between React, Angular, and Vue.js, and discuss the trade-offs when choosing one over the others for a particular project?
    
3.  How would you optimize a Node.js API server for high throughput and low latency? What tools or techniques would you use to identify bottlenecks and performance issues?
    
4.  Can you discuss the pros and cons of using gRPC versus REST for communication between microservices? In what situations would you choose one over the other?
    
5.  What are some best practices when designing a GraphQL schema, and how would you handle security concerns such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting?
    
6.  Can you explain the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed databases? How would you choose between different NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase) based on the CAP theorem and the specific requirements of a project?
    
7.  How do you approach implementing real-time features (e.g., notifications, chat, etc.) in a web application? What technologies or techniques would you use, and what are some common pitfalls to avoid?
    
8.  Can you compare and contrast the performance characteristics of C++17 and Go for systems programming?
