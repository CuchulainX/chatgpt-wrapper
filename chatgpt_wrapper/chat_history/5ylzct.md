Certainly! In the book "Dopamine Nation," the author Dr. Anna Lembke discusses the role of group dynamics in addiction and recovery.

Dr. Lembke also discusses the concept of "tribalism," where individuals seek out groups that share their values and beliefs. For people struggling with addiction, finding a supportive community of people who understand their experiences and can offer encouragement and accountability can be essential for recovery.
