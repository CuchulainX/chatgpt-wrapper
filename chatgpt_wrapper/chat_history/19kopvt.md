The error message indicates that `self.superuser` is `None` and therefore does not have the `get` method called on it. The `self.superuser` attribute is a property that returns the result of calling the `get_superuser` method on `AvailableService` class. Therefore, the first thing to tackle is to identify why `get_superuser` is returning `None`.

From the debug logs, we can see that `get_superuser` is making a request to `app-services.service.consul:9999/login` with some data. The response is then checked, and if it is successful, the response body is saved to the `AvailableService.superusers` dictionary and returned.

Therefore, the next thing to investigate is whether the request to `app-services.service.consul:9999/login` is returning a successful response and if the response body contains the expected data. You can try printing out the `response` object before the `superuser = json.loads(response.read())` line to see if there is any error.

Additionally, if the request is successful, you can check the `AvailableService.superusers` dictionary to see if the data is being stored correctly.

Finally, you can also check if there are any issues with the `server` and `port` parameters that are being passed to `get_superuser`. You can print these values to see if they are correct.

Overall, it appears that the issue is likely related to the request to `app-services.service.consul:9999/login` failing, so that is the first thing to investigate.

> What does this nomad error mean? app-services-hub 1 unplaced Constraint ${meta.system} set\_contains service filtered 3 nodes Resources exhausted on 2 nodes Dimension network: reserved port collision http=9999 exhausted on 2 nodes
> 
> 1 / 1

This Nomad error message indicates that the `app-services-hub` job cannot be placed on any of the available nodes due to resource constraints. The error message mentions two types of constraints:

1.  `${meta.system} set_contains service filtered 3 nodes`: This constraint is related to the job placement based on the value of a custom metadata field `meta.system`. It specifies that the job must be placed on a node that has the `meta.system` field set to a value that belongs to the set of values specified in the constraint. In this case, it seems that the set of values has been filtered down to three nodes that satisfy this constraint.
    
2.  `Dimension network: reserved port collision http=9999 exhausted on 2 nodes`: This constraint is related to the network port resources required by the job. It indicates that two nodes have already reserved the port `9999` for some other service, and therefore, there are no more available ports for this job on those nodes.
    

Based on this error message, it seems that the job placement is failing due to resource constraints related to custom metadata and network ports. To resolve this error, you can try the following:

1.  Check the custom metadata field `meta.system` to ensure that it is correctly set on all the nodes where the job can be placed.
    
2.  Check if there are any other jobs or services running on the same network port (`9999`) on the affected nodes. If so, try to free up the port or use a different port for this job.
    
3.  If the above steps do not help, consider increasing the number of nodes available for job placement by adding more nodes to the Nomad cluster.
    

Overall, this error indicates that the Nomad scheduler is unable to find a suitable node to place the `app-services-hub` job due to resource constraints, so you need to investigate and address these constraints to resolve the issue.

From the logs provided, it appears that a Hazelcast client is being started with configuration loaded from a file located at `/local/hazelcast.xml`. The client is using a non-empty group password for authentication and is connecting to a Hazelcast cluster named `dev`.

The client attempts to connect to a Hazelcast cluster member at address `traefik.service.consul:8125`. The connection is successfully established, and the client is authenticated with the server.

After authentication, the Hazelcast client receives a list of cluster members, which contains only one member with the IP address `10.1.3.2` and port `5701`. The client then enters the `CLIENT_CONNECTED` state, indicating that it has successfully connected to the Hazelcast cluster.

However, shortly after entering the `CLIENT_CONNECTED` state, the client receives a `SHUTTING_DOWN` message and is then shutdown. It seems that some error or event occurred that caused the client to disconnect and shutdown.

Without further logs or context, it is difficult to determine the cause of the shutdown. However, it may be related to the warnings about illegal reflective access operations that occurred during client startup. You may want to investigate these warnings to see if they are related to the shutdown issue. Additionally, enabling Hazelcast diagnostics may provide more information about the issue.

> 1 / 1

These messages indicate that the Hazelcast Management Center (HMC) has a scheduled task for cleaning up disabled logins, which is running at intervals of one hour. The messages show the start and completion of this scheduled task.

The `DisableLoginStrategy` class is responsible for managing login disabling in HMC. When a user attempts to log in to the HMC with incorrect credentials multiple times, the login is disabled for a specified amount of time to prevent brute-force attacks. Once the specified time has elapsed, the `DisableLoginStrategy` enables the login again.

The `scheduled disabled login cleanup` task mentioned in the messages is responsible for removing the disabled login entries that have expired and re-enabling the associated logins. The cleanup task runs at intervals of one hour to ensure that disabled logins are not permanently disabled and to keep the login system secure.

These logs are from a Hazelcast cluster node with IP address 10.1.3.2 running version 3.12.10. Here are some key points:

*   The first two logs indicate that a connection to a client with a certain UUID was closed by the other side.
*   The next log shows some system statistics including the heap memory usage and the number of threads.
*   The fourth log shows that a connection to a Python client with a certain UUID was closed by the other side.
*   The fifth log shows that a client with a certain UUID successfully authenticated.
*   The sixth log indicates that a connection was closed by the other side.
*   The last log shows updated system statistics including heap memory usage and the number of threads.

The server is not explicitly "destroying" the client. Instead, it is destroying a client endpoint that represents a connection between the server and a specific client. This could happen for various reasons, such as:

1.  The client has disconnected from the server and the endpoint is no longer needed.
2.  The server has detected that the client is no longer responsive and is terminating the connection.
3.  The client has been explicitly removed or stopped by an administrator or other external process.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the specific reason why the client endpoint is being destroyed in this particular case.

> will a hazelcast 3.12.10 server disconnect a client 3.12.7
> 
> 1 / 1

It is possible for a Hazelcast 3.12.10 server to disconnect a client running version 3.12.7, but it depends on the configuration and the reason for the disconnection. In general, Hazelcast supports backwards compatibility between minor releases, which means that a newer server version should be able to communicate with an older client version. However, there could be compatibility issues if there are significant changes in the protocol or APIs between the two versions.

If the disconnection is due to a network issue or a timeout, it is unlikely to be related to the version mismatch. However, if the server has been configured to enforce a minimum client version or there are protocol changes between the two versions that prevent proper communication, the server may disconnect the client. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the server and client versions are compatible and to configure them accordingly to avoid potential issues.
