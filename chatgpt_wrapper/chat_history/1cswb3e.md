The quickest way to enter ketosis is by following a very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, which typically involves consuming less than 20-50 grams of carbohydrates per day. When you restrict carbohydrates to such a low level, your body's glycogen stores are depleted within a few days, and it begins to produce ketones from stored fat as an alternative fuel source. This process is called ketosis, and it can usually be achieved within 2-4 days of starting a very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet.

In addition to a low-carbohydrate diet, some people use exogenous ketones, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplements, to help speed up the process of entering ketosis. However, it's important to note that exogenous ketones alone are unlikely to induce ketosis unless combined with a low-carbohydrate diet or fasting.

It's also important to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medication.
