If you have chosen to include Celery in your Django project using Cookiecutter, and you now want to remove it, you can follow these steps:

1.  Delete Celery-related files: In your project directory, delete the following files:

*   `celery.py`
*   `tasks.py`
*   `celery_app/` directory

2.  Remove Celery from installed apps: Open your project's `settings.py` file and remove `'celery'` from the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
    
3.  Remove Celery-related configuration: In your project's `settings.py` file, remove the following code:
    

makefile

```makefile
# Celery Configuration
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://redis:6379/0'
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://redis:6379/0'
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['application/json']
CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_TIMEZONE = TIME_ZONE
```

4.  Remove Celery from your project's requirements: Open your project's `requirements/base.txt` file and remove the following line:

`celery`

5.  Remove Celery-related code: Finally, search for any code in your project that imports or uses Celery and remove it.

Once you have completed these steps, Celery should be removed from your Django project.

In a Django Cookiecutter project, the SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) files are typically stored in a directory named `migrations` within each app of your project.

When you create a model in Django, the framework generates a corresponding migration file that contains the SQL code needed to create the table associated with that model in your database. These migration files are stored in the `migrations` directory of the app that the model belongs to.

For example, if you have an app named `blog` in your Django project, the `migrations` directory for that app will be located at `your_project_directory/blog/migrations/`. The migration files in this directory are named with a prefix that indicates the order they were created in, followed by a brief description of what they do. For instance, the first migration file generated for the `blog` app might be named `0001_initial.py`.

If you want to view the SQL code contained in a migration file, you can open the file in a text editor and look for the `operations` attribute of the `migrations.Migration` class. This attribute contains a list of Django migration operations, each of which generates a specific SQL command when the migration is run.
