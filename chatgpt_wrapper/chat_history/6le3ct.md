Why should a job seeker be intentional in choosing a new job? Because it can significantly impact their career trajectory, overall job satisfaction, and quality of life.

When searching for a new job, it's important for job seekers to identify their priorities and assess whether the potential role and company align with their values and goals. Some key factors to consider include:

1.  Company culture: A positive and supportive work culture can contribute to employee happiness and job satisfaction. Job seekers should research the company culture through online reviews, social media, and conversations with current or former employees.
    
2.  Growth opportunities: Many job seekers are looking for opportunities to develop their skills and advance their careers. It's important to assess the potential for growth within a company, including opportunities for training, promotions, and leadership roles.
    
3.  Compensation and benefits: Financial considerations are an important factor for many job seekers. It's important to understand the salary and benefits package being offered and assess whether it aligns with industry standards and personal expectations.
    
4.  Work-life balance: Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is critical for long-term job satisfaction and overall well-being. Job seekers should assess the company's policies around flexible work arrangements, vacation time, and other benefits that support work-life balance.
    
5.  Job responsibilities: It's important to understand the day-to-day responsibilities of the job and ensure they align with the job seeker's skills and interests. Job seekers should also assess the potential for job burnout and stress levels associated with the role.
    

Ultimately, the goal for any job seeker should be to find a job that aligns with their values and priorities, provides opportunities for growth and development, and contributes to their overall happiness and well-being. By being intentional and thorough in their job search, job seekers can increase the likelihood of finding a job that meets these criteria and sets them up for long-term success.

> 1 / 1

To explore their "start with why" reason for a new job, a job seeker can start by reflecting on their values, passions, and goals. Some questions they can ask themselves include:

1.  What motivates me? What inspires me to get out of bed in the morning?
    
2.  What are my core values, and how do they align with potential employers?
    
3.  What are my long-term career goals, and how does this job fit into my larger plan?
    
4.  What do I enjoy doing, and how can I find a job that allows me to do more of it?
    
5.  What impact do I want to have on the world, and how can this job help me achieve that?
    

By reflecting on these questions, a job seeker can identify their personal "why" and use that as a guiding principle for their job search. This can help them focus on jobs and companies that align with their values and goals, increasing the likelihood of finding a fulfilling and rewarding career. It's also important to keep in mind that this "why" may evolve over time, so regular self-reflection and reassessment can help job seekers stay aligned with their values and goals throughout their career.

Discovering what motivates and inspires you can be a deeply personal and introspective process. Here are a few strategies to help you explore these questions:

1.  Reflect on past experiences: Think about times in your life when you felt the most energized, fulfilled, and engaged. What were you doing? What made those experiences meaningful to you? This can help you identify your passions and the types of work that you find most rewarding.
    
2.  Explore your values: Consider what is most important to you in life. This might include things like creativity, connection with others, personal growth, or social impact. Understanding your values can help you identify work that aligns with your priorities and feels meaningful.
    
3.  Engage in self-discovery activities: There are many resources available to help you explore your motivations and values, such as personality tests, career assessments, and self-reflection exercises. These can provide insights into your strengths, interests, and work style.
    
4.  Seek out new experiences: Sometimes, it's hard to know what you're passionate about until you try it. Consider volunteering, taking a class, or exploring a new hobby to gain exposure to new experiences and identify what you find most fulfilling.
    

Ultimately, discovering what motivates and inspires you is an ongoing process that may require some experimentation, reflection, and self-discovery. By taking the time to explore these questions, you can gain valuable insights into yourself and what you want from your career, which can help guide your job search and lead to a more fulfilling and rewarding work life.

> 1 / 1

Finding out your core values can be a deeply personal and introspective process. Here are a few strategies that can help you identify and clarify your core values:

1.  Make a list: Write down a list of values that resonate with you. Examples might include honesty, respect, fairness, creativity, connection with others, personal growth, or social impact. Try to identify the values that feel most important to you, and that you want to embody in your life and work.
    
2.  Reflect on your life experiences: Think about times in your life when you felt the most fulfilled and engaged. What was it about those experiences that made them meaningful to you? What values did those experiences align with? This can help you identify values that are already present in your life.
    
3.  Consider what frustrates or upsets you: Sometimes, identifying what we don't want can help us clarify what we do want. Consider situations or behaviors that you find frustrating or upsetting. What values are being violated in those situations? The opposite of those values may be important to you.
    
4.  Take a values assessment: There are many online assessments that can help you identify your core values, such as the Personal Values Assessment or the Values in Action Inventory. These assessments can provide a starting point for understanding what's most important to you.
    
5.  Seek input from others: Talk to friends, family, or colleagues about what they see as your core values. Sometimes, the way others see us can provide valuable insights into our own values and strengths.
    

Ultimately, identifying your core values is a personal process that may require some self-reflection, exploration, and introspection. By clarifying your values, you can gain a better understanding of what's most important to you, and use that knowledge to guide your decisions and actions in your personal and professional life.
