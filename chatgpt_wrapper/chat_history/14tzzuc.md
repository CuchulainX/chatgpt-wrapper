> Can you give me a simple schema for tracking OKRs?
> 
> 1 / 1

A simple schema for tracking OKRs can consist of a table or spreadsheet with the following columns:

1.  Objective Number (e.g., O1, O2, O3, etc.)
2.  Objective Description
3.  Key Result Number (e.g., O1.1, O1.2, O1.3, etc.)
4.  Key Result Description
5.  Target (specific metric, percentage, or milestone)
6.  Current Progress (update regularly, e.g., monthly or quarterly)
7.  Progress Percentage (calculated based on Target and Current Progress)
8.  Status (e.g., On Track, At Risk, Off Track, or Completed)
9.  Notes or Comments (optional, for additional context or action items)

Here's an example schema for the first objective from the previous list of OKRs:

```
| Objective Number | Objective Description | Key Result Number | Key Result Description | Target | Current Progress | Progress Percentage | Status | Notes / Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| O1 | Increase customer base and revenue | O1.1 | Achieve a 25% increase in new customers by the end of the year | 25% | 10% | 40% | On Track | \- |
| O1 | Increase customer base and revenue | O1.2 | Boost monthly recurring revenue (MRR) by 30% YoY | 30% | 15% | 50% | On Track | \- |
| O1 | Increase customer base and revenue | O1.3 | Improve customer lifetime value (LTV) by 20% YoY | 20% | 5% | 25% | At Risk | Need more upsell opportunities |
```

Create a table or spreadsheet with this schema and update it regularly to track the progress of your OKRs. Make sure to review and discuss the progress with your team during regular check-ins or meetings to identify any challenges, celebrate achievements, and adjust your plans as needed.
