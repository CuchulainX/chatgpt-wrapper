To enable logging in Traefik, you can add the following configuration to your `traefik.toml` or `traefik.yml` file:

yaml

```yaml
log:
  level: DEBUG
```

This will enable debug-level logging, which is the most verbose logging level. You can adjust the logging level to one of the following levels:

*   `DEBUG`: The most verbose logging level, which includes all messages.
*   `INFO`: A less verbose logging level, which includes important messages and warnings.
*   `WARN`: A logging level that includes only warnings and errors.
*   `ERROR`: The least verbose logging level, which includes only errors.

You can also configure where the logs are output by adding the following to your configuration file:

yaml

```yaml
log:
  filePath: "/var/log/traefik.log"
```

This will write the logs to the specified file path. If you don't specify a file path, Traefik will log to stdout by default.

Note that Traefik supports multiple logging backends, including file, syslog, and others. You can find more information on logging configuration in the Traefik documentation: [https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/observability/logs/](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/observability/logs/)

To enable logging for the Traefik job in Nomad, you can add the following `log` stanza to your job definition:

hcl

```hcl
job "traefik" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type        = "service"

  group "traefik" {
    count = 1

    task "traefik" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "traefik:v2.5"

        # Traefik configuration goes here...

        log_config {
          max_files      = 10
          max_file_size  = 10
          rotate         = "30m"
          compress       = true
        }
      }

      # ...Task configuration goes here...
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `log_config` stanza specifies the maximum number of log files to keep (`max_files`), the maximum size of each log file (`max_file_size`), how often to rotate log files (`rotate`), and whether to compress old log files (`compress`).

You can adjust these settings to suit your needs. Note that this example assumes you're using the Docker driver to run the Traefik container. If you're using a different driver, you may need to adjust the configuration accordingly.

Additionally, you can configure the logging level for Traefik by adding a `command` stanza to your task configuration:

hcl

```hcl
task "traefik" {
  driver = "docker"

  config {
    image = "traefik:v2.5"

    # Traefik configuration goes here...

    log_config {
      max_files      = 10
      max_file_size  = 10
      rotate         = "30m"
      compress       = true
    }
  }

  command = "/traefik --log.level=DEBUG"

  # ...Task configuration goes here...
}
```

In this example, the `command` stanza specifies the command to run inside the container, including the `--log.level` option to set the logging level to `DEBUG`. You can adjust the logging level to one of the other levels (INFO, WARN, or ERROR) if you prefer.
