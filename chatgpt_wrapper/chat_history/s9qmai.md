1.  Preparation:

a. Understand the job requirements: Familiarize yourself with the specific skills and knowledge required for the role. Review the job description, and consult with the hiring manager or team members to identify the key competencies.

b. Create an interview plan: Determine the topics you want to cover during the interview, such as coding, problem-solving, debugging, and system design. Plan the sequence and allot time for each topic.

c. Prepare questions and exercises: Develop a list of technical questions and exercises that will allow you to assess the candidate's skills effectively. You can use a mix of theoretical questions, coding problems, and system design exercises.

2.  Structuring the interview:

a. Introduction: Start by introducing yourself and explaining the agenda of the interview. Set expectations about the interview format and duration.
