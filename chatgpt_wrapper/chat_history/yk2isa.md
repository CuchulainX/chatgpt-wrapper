Testing a web and mobile application in the book industry that delivers ebooks and audiobooks to end-users requires a comprehensive testing approach to ensure a seamless user experience. Here's how I would approach testing this application:

1.  Functional Testing: Functional testing is the process of ensuring that the web and mobile application meets the specified requirements. In this case, the main functionalities to test would include ebook and audiobook delivery, website book catalogue, landing pages and sales funnel, and ingestion of books from publishers via FTP. The objective is to ensure that all these functionalities are working correctly and are user-friendly.
    
2.  Performance Testing: Performance testing would involve measuring how well the system performs under different conditions. This testing would include load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing. The objective is to ensure that the system can handle large volumes of requests without crashing or becoming slow.
    
3.  Usability Testing: Usability testing would involve assessing how user-friendly the app is. The objective would be to ensure that the user interface and user experience are intuitive and easy to use. This testing would involve testing various scenarios and situations to ensure that the user can quickly find and use the desired features.
    
4.  Security Testing: Security testing would involve testing the application's security features, such as authentication, authorization, and data encryption. The objective would be to ensure that the application is secure and that user data is protected from unauthorized access.
    

To ensure the reliability and scalability of the backend content hub, I would employ the following strategies:

1.  Categorization of Books: The internal marketing team would categorize the books into different genres, languages, and other relevant attributes. The objective is to ensure that the books are correctly classified, and the user can easily find the desired book.
    
2.  Selection and Deployment of Books: The selection and deployment of books to the customer-facing app 'Services' would involve a rigorous testing process to ensure that only the correct and fully functional books are deployed.
    

To verify the functionality and performance of the app on both IOS and Android, and ensure a seamless user experience with the integrated EPub reader (a Tolino), I would use the following testing techniques and tools:

1.  Automation Testing: Automation testing would involve using tools like Appium, Selenium, and TestComplete to create automated scripts to test the app's functionality and performance on both IOS and Android platforms.
    
2.  Manual Testing: Manual testing would involve testing the app's functionality and performance by manually testing different scenarios and situations. This testing would help identify any usability issues and help improve the user experience.
    
3.  User Acceptance Testing: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) would involve getting feedback from end-users. This testing would help identify any usability issues and help improve the user experience.
    
4.  Performance Testing: Performance testing would involve using tools like JMeter and Gatling to measure how well the system performs under different conditions. This testing would help identify any bottlenecks and help improve the system's performance.
    

In conclusion, testing a web and mobile application in the book industry requires a comprehensive testing approach that covers functional, performance, usability, and security testing. Employing effective strategies to ensure the reliability and scalability of the backend content hub is also essential. The use of automation testing, manual testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing is critical to verifying the functionality and performance of the app on both IOS and Android platforms and ensuring a seamless user experience with the integrated EPub reader (a Tolino).
