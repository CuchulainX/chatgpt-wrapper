As an AI language model, I do not have access to specific contracts or agreements between companies. However, the example I provided is based on common provisions and practices found in recruitment services agreements between recruitment companies and their clients. The language used in the agreement is similar to what one might expect to find in a typical recruitment services agreement, but it is not meant to be a substitute for legal advice. It is always recommended that both parties consult with legal counsel when drafting or reviewing any contract or agreement.

Recruiter will not make any guarantees as to the employment of any candidate, and does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by the candidate.

Client may reject any candidate referred by Recruiter at any time, and Recruiter will use its best efforts to continue to identify and present qualified candidates to Client.
