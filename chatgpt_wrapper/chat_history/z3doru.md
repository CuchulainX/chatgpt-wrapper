I apologize for the confusion. The `CERT_NONE` attribute is not available in the `http.client` module in Python. Instead, you can use the `ssl` module to create an unverified SSL context.

Here is an example of how you can use the `ssl` module to create an unverified SSL context and use it to create an HTTP connection:

python

```python
import http.client
import ssl

# Create an unverified SSL context
context = ssl.create_default_context()
context.check_hostname = False
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

# Create an HTTP connection with the unverified SSL context
conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(ip, port, context=context)
```

This should allow you to create an HTTP connection without verifying the SSL certificate. Please note that this can potentially expose you to security risks, so it should be used with caution.
