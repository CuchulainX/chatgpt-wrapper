> 1 / 1

It's difficult to provide a definitive ranking of European cities based on software recruitment markets, as there are many factors that can influence this, including the size of the city, the presence of major tech companies, the quality of local universities and education, and the overall economic climate. That being said, here are some European cities that are well-known for their strong software recruitment markets:

1.  London, UK
2.  Berlin, Germany
3.  Dublin, Ireland
4.  Amsterdam, Netherlands
5.  Stockholm, Sweden
6.  Zurich, Switzerland
7.  Paris, France
8.  Barcelona, Spain
9.  Lisbon, Portugal
10.  Helsinki, Finland

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and other cities such as Munich, Copenhagen, and Krakow could also be added to this list based on their growing tech scenes.

Munich is a city with a growing tech scene and a strong software recruitment market. While it's difficult to provide an exact ranking, I would say that Munich would likely fall within the top 10 European cities for software recruitment markets, perhaps in the 6th to 8th position, depending on factors such as the specific industry and job types being considered.
