Python tuples and lists are both used to store collections of items, but they have some key differences:

1.  Mutability:
    
    *   List: Lists are mutable, which means that you can change their contents (add, remove, or modify items) after they are created.
    *   Tuple: Tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. This can be useful for ensuring data consistency and protecting it from accidental modification.
2.  Syntax:
    
    *   List: Lists are created using square brackets, like this: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.
    *   Tuple: Tuples are created using parentheses, like this: \`my\_tuple = (1,

> 1 / 1

In Python, dunder (short for "double underscore") methods or variables are special methods that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names. They are also sometimes called "magic methods." These methods are used to implement or customize certain behaviors in a class. Here are some important dunder methods and variables in Python:

1.  `__init__(self, ...)`: This method is called the constructor or initializer. It is automatically called when an object is created from a class. It is used to set initial values for the instance variables and perform any setup required.
    
2.  `__str__(self)`: This method returns a human-readable string representation of the object. It is called by the built-in `str()` function and by
