> So, I've just attended an online version of the step 10 workshop that well take place in Munich on the 7th of May. Participants are asked to take a paper and pen and after some instruction they write about a resentment. In the Munich version the participants will all be together and only the host will be online. I'm looking for ways in which the in person version could be enhanced. Any ideas!

> 1 / 1

Here are some ideas for enhancing the in-person version of the Step 10 workshop:

1.  Small group discussions: Divide participants into small groups and have them discuss their resentments with each other. This can be a more intimate and supportive environment for people to share their thoughts and feelings.
    
2.  Guided meditation: Incorporate a guided meditation session into the workshop where participants can reflect on their resentments and work on letting go of negative emotions.
    
3.  One-on-one coaching: Offer one-on-one coaching sessions with an experienced AA member to help participants work through their resentments and offer guidance and support.
    
4.  Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities into the workshop to help participants process their emotions, such as art therapy, journaling, or role-playing exercises.
    
5.  Outdoor activities: If possible, consider holding the workshop in a natural setting or including an outdoor activity to promote relaxation and encourage participants to connect with nature.
    
6.  Guest speaker: Invite a guest speaker, such as a mental health professional or an experienced AA member, to offer their expertise and insights on the topic of resentment and Step 10.
    
7.  Peer support groups: Offer participants the opportunity to connect with each other and form peer support groups that they can continue to engage with after the workshop.
    

By incorporating these ideas into the in-person version of the workshop, you can create a supportive and engaging environment for participants to work through their resentments and continue on their journey of sobriety.
