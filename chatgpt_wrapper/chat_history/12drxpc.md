To better troubleshoot the network issues, you can try the following steps:

1.  Verify the URLs: Check if the URLs in the post request are correct and match the expected URLs for the server.
    
2.  Verify the authorization credentials: Check if the authorization credentials provided in the post request are correct and valid.
    
3.  Check the firewall settings: Verify the firewall settings of the server and the client to ensure that the appropriate ports are open for communication.
    
4.  Check the DNS settings: Verify the DNS settings of the client and server to ensure that the domain name resolves to the correct IP address.
    
5.  Use traceroute: Use the traceroute command to identify the network path taken between the client and server. This can help identify any network hops causing delays or errors.
    
6.  Check the server logs: Check the logs on the server to identify any errors or issues that may be causing the responses.
    
7.  Contact the support team: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can contact the support team of the server or service to get further assistance.

You're correct, I apologize for not fully understanding the issue earlier. The fact that the same curl request is receiving different responses depending on the client could indicate that there are some network or security settings that are affecting the responses.

Some possible causes could include:

1.  IP or geographic blocking: The server may be blocking requests from certain IP addresses or geographic locations, which could explain why some clients are receiving a 404 or 403 response.
    
2.  User-agent blocking: The server may be blocking requests from certain user agents or web browsers, which could explain why some clients are receiving a 404 or 403 response.
    
3.  Network latency or connectivity issues: There may be network latency or connectivity issues between some clients and the server, which could result in the server not receiving or processing the requests correctly.
    
4.  Security settings or access controls: There may be security settings or access controls on the server that are preventing some clients from accessing certain resources or endpoints, which could result in a 404 or 403 response.
    

To troubleshoot this issue, you may need to further investigate the network and security settings between the clients and server to identify any differences that could explain the varying responses. It may also be helpful to contact the server or service provider for assistance in identifying and resolving the issue.
