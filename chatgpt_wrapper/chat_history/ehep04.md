As an AI language model, I have been trained on a vast amount of information, including Irish planning law. However, I cannot provide a specific score on a scale of 0-100 regarding my knowledge of Irish planning law, as my knowledge is constantly updating based on new information and developments in the field. That being said, I am here to help answer any questions you may have to the best of my abilities based on my training and available information.

> 1 / 1

The case of Burke v. FBD Insurance is a landmark case in Irish insurance law. The case was heard in the High Court of Ireland and the judgment was delivered on 1st October 2020.

The case centered on the interpretation of business interruption insurance policies and whether or not they covered losses incurred by the policyholders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The outcome of the case was that the judge, Mr. Justice Denis McDonald, ruled that the business interruption insurance policy taken out by the plaintiff, a pub owner, covered losses incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The judge found that the policy covered the plaintiff for losses caused by the closure of his business due to the pandemic, and that the policy did not contain any exclusion clause that would limit the cover for such losses.

The outcome of the case is significant as it has potential implications for other policyholders who have suffered losses due to the pandemic and have business interruption insurance policies. However, it should be noted that the outcome of this case does not automatically mean that all policyholders with similar policies are entitled to coverage for losses due to the pandemic. Each case will depend on its own facts and the specific terms and conditions of the insurance policy in question.

I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have access to up-to-date information on the cases of individuals unless they have been widely reported on in the news or other publicly available sources. Without more specific information, I'm unable to provide you with details on Tom Burke, the retired teacher from Drogheda, and any recent cases he may have been involved in. However, if you have more information about the case or cases you are referring to, I'll be happy to try and assist you further.
