To publish a note from Notion to a website, you can follow these steps:

1.  Open the Notion page you want to publish.
2.  Click on the three dots icon in the top right corner of the page.
3.  Select "Duplicate" to create a copy of the page.
4.  On the duplicated page, click on the three dots icon again and select "Share."
5.  In the "Share" menu, click on the "Embed" tab.
6.  Adjust the width and height of the embedded content as necessary.
7.  Copy the code provided in the "Embed" section.
8.  Paste the code into the HTML code of your website where you want the Notion page to appear.

Keep in mind that embedding a Notion page on a website will only show the content of the page itself, and any changes made to the original Notion page will not be reflected on the website unless you update the embed code.
