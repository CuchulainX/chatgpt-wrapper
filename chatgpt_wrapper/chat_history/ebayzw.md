> Can you give me the database schema for a simple CRM
> 
> 1 / 1

Sure, here's an example of a simple database schema for a CRM:

The CRM has three main tables:

1.  Customers table: This table stores information about the customers, including their name, email, phone number, address, and any additional notes.

markdown

```markdown
Customers
----------
customer_id (PK)
first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
address
notes
```

2.  Sales table: This table stores information about sales, including the date of the sale, the customer who made the purchase, the product(s) purchased, and the total amount paid.

markdown

```markdown
Sales
-----
sale_id (PK)
sale_date
customer_id (FK)
product_name
product_quantity
total_amount
```

3.  Tasks table: This table stores information about tasks, including the due date, task description, and the customer associated with the task.

markdown

```markdown
Tasks
-----
task_id (PK)
due_date
task_description
customer_id (FK)
```

In this schema, the `customer_id` field in the Sales and Tasks tables is a foreign key that refers back to the primary key in the Customers table. This enables us to link sales and tasks to specific customers in the CRM.

4.  Connect your LinkedIn account to Zapier by following the prompts.
    
5.  Set up the Notion action by selecting Notion as the action app and choosing the action you want to perform. For example, you could choose "Create a Page" to create a new Notion page for each new lead in LinkedIn.
    
6.  Connect your Notion account to Zapier by following the prompts.
    
7.  Map the fields from LinkedIn to the corresponding fields in Notion.
