> 1 / 1

Vitamins D3 and K2 are often taken together because they work synergistically to promote bone health and cardiovascular health.

Vitamin D3 is important for the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the gut, which are necessary for the growth and maintenance of healthy bones. Vitamin K2, on the other hand, helps to direct calcium to the bones and teeth, while preventing it from accumulating in the arteries and soft tissues.

When taken together, vitamin D3 and K2 can help to ensure that calcium is properly utilized and distributed throughout the body, promoting overall bone health and reducing the risk of osteoporosis. Additionally, research has suggested that the combination of these two vitamins may also have a positive effect on cardiovascular health, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease.

It is important to note that while vitamin D3 and K2 are often taken together, it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.
