> I'm migrating a number of microservices from AWS the German Cloud Provider Hetzner. The migration involves setup of the environment in Hetzner using Terraform, changes to how the microservices are built to use Jenkins. Database must be replicated and migrated. Android and IOS apps must be tested. It's quite complex. Can you come up with a Skeleton Project Plan, that includes a sub-project that I could duplicate for each microservice.

A skeleton project plan can help you outline the steps required to complete your migration from AWS to Hetzner, as well as set up your environment using Terraform and Jenkins. Here's a high-level plan that you can use as a starting point, with a sub-project template for each microservice:

1.  Project Initiation 1.1. Define project scope and objectives 1.2. Identify stakeholders 1.3. Develop project charter 1.4. Obtain project approval
    
2.  Planning 2.1. Define project team and roles 2.2. Establish communication plan 2.3. Develop migration strategy 2.4. Create work breakdown structure (WBS) and project schedule 2.5. Identify risks and develop risk management plan
    
3.  Environment Setup 3.1. Set up Terraform on Hetzner Cloud 3.2. Configure network, storage, and security resources 3.3. Set up Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment
    
4.  Database Migration 4.1. Assess database schema and data volume 4.2. Select appropriate migration tools 4.3. Plan and execute database replication 4.4. Test and validate data migration
    
5.  Microservices Migration (Sub-Project Template - Duplicate for each microservice) 5.1. Analyze microservice architecture and dependencies 5.2. Update microservice configuration for Hetzner environment 5.3. Migrate source code and build artifacts to Jenkins 5.4. Configure Jenkins pipelines for build, test, and

deployment 5.5. Test microservice deployment in Hetzner environment 5.6. Validate and optimize performance 5.7. Update documentation 5.8. Sign-off on migrated microservice

6.  Mobile App Testing 6.1. Update Android and iOS apps to use migrated microservices 6.2. Perform functional and performance testing on both platforms 6.3. Validate API integrations and compatibility 6.4. Address any issues and retest
    
7.  Transition and Go-Live 7.1. Develop and execute transition plan (DNS, API gateways, etc.) 7.2. Monitor migrated services for stability and performance 7.3. Address any post-migration issues 7.4. Confirm stakeholder acceptance and go-live
    
8.  Project Closeout 8.1. Conduct lessons learned and post-implementation review 8.2. Update project documentation and archive materials 8.3. Release project resources and close contracts 8.4. Celebrate project success and acknowledge team efforts
    

This high-level skeleton project plan covers the major aspects of your migration project, from initiation to closeout. You can adjust and expand this plan to fit your specific needs and requirements. Remember to track progress and adjust your plan as necessary to ensure a successful migration.
