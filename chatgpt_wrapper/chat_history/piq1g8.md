2.  Click on "Create Task" in the "Actions" panel on the right-hand side of the Task Scheduler window.
3.  In the "General" tab of the Create Task window, give a name for the task, choose the operating system that you're running, and select "Run whether user is logged on or not".
4.  Go to the "Triggers" tab and click on "New". In the "New Trigger" window, set the trigger as per your requirement (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
5.  Go to the "Actions" tab and click on "New". In the "New Action" window, select "Start a program" as the action and enter "cmd.exe" in the "Program/script" field.
6.  In the "Add arguments (optional)" field, enter the following command: /c start [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com) (replace "[http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com)" with the URL of the web page you want to open).
