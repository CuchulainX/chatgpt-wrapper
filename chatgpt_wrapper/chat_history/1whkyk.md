> Here's the AA Daily Reflection for today: GUIDANCE February 22 . . . this means a belief in a Creator who is all power, justice, and love; a God who intends for me a purpose, a meaning, and a destiny to grow, however . . . haltingly, toward His own likeness and image. AS BILL SEES IT, p. 51 As I began to understand my own powerlessness and my dependence on God, as I understand Him, I began to see that there was a life which, if I could have it, I would have chosen for myself from the beginning. It is through the continuing work of the Steps and the life in the Fellowship that I've learned to see that there is truly a better way into which I am being guided. As I come to know more about God, I am able to trust His ways and His plans for the development of His character in me. Quickly or not so quickly, I grow toward His own image and likeness. Can you give me some ideas on what I might share in a Zoom meeting about it?

Sure, I can certainly do that! Here's an example of how you might share your thoughts in a more personal, narrative style:

When I first came to AA, I was skeptical about the idea of a higher power or Creator. I didn't really believe in God, and the thought of having to rely on something outside of myself for my sobriety was a little scary to me. But as I kept coming back to meetings and working the Steps, I started to see things a little differently.

One of the things that really resonated with me was the idea that there is a better way into which I am being guided. At first, I wasn't really sure what that meant. But as I kept working the program, I began to see that there was a life I could have for myself - a life of purpose, meaning, and growth - that was so much better than the one I had been living.

As I started to believe in a higher power, I began to trust that this power had a plan for me. I started to see that my addiction was actually an opportunity for growth, and that by surrendering to this power, I could become the person I was meant to be. It hasn't been an easy journey, and there have definitely been times when I've struggled to trust in this power. But as I've continued to work the Steps and stay connected to the Fellowship, I've seen myself grow and change in ways I never thought possible.

One of the things that has been really helpful for me in my recovery journey has been my spiritual practice. I've found that prayer and meditation help me to connect with my higher power and stay grounded, even when things feel difficult. And being a part of the AA community has been incredibly important for me as well. It's been so inspiring to see others in the Fellowship working toward the same goal of growth and transformation, and I'm grateful for the support and encouragement I've received from others along the way.

If there's one thing I would want to share with others who might be struggling, it's that there is hope. Even if you don't believe in a higher power right now, that's okay. Just keep coming back to meetings and keep an open mind. As you work the Steps and stay connected to the Fellowship, you might be surprised at how much you can grow and change. I know I certainly was.

> Here is the Daily Reflection for 23 FEB: MYSTERIOUS PARADOXES February 23 Such is the paradox of A.A. regeneration: strength arising out of complete defeat and weakness, the loss of one's old life as a condition for finding a new one. A.A. COMES OF AGE, p. 46 What glorious mysteries paradoxes are! They do not compute, yet when recognized and accepted, they reaffirm something in the universe beyond human logic. When I face a fear, I am given courage; when I support a brother or sister, my capacity to love myself is increased; when I accept pain as part of the growing experience of life, I realize a greater happiness; when I look at my dark side, I am brought into new light; when I accept my vulnerabilities and surrender to a Higher Power, I am graced with unforeseen strength. I stumbled through the doors of A.A. in disgrace, expecting nothing from life, and I have been given hope and dignity. Miraculously, the only way to keep the gifts of the program is to pass them on. In a narrative style similar to above, what can I share about it?

Certainly! Here's an example of how you might share your thoughts on the Daily Reflection for February 23 in a personal, narrative style:

---

When I first read the Daily Reflection for today, I was struck by the idea that strength can arise out of complete defeat and weakness. That's definitely been my experience in recovery. When I first came to AA, I was at the lowest point of my life. I had lost everything - my job, my family, my health - and I didn't think I could ever get it back. I was completely defeated, and I didn't have any strength left.

But somehow, through the program of AA, I found a new way of life. I had to lose my old life - the life of addiction and self-destruction - in order to find a new one. And it was a paradox, because it didn't make logical sense. How could I find strength in weakness? How could I gain a new life by losing my old one? But that's exactly what happened.

As I worked the Steps and stayed connected to the Fellowship, I started to see these mysterious paradoxes all around me. When I faced my fears, I was given the courage to keep going. When I supported others in the program, I found that I loved myself more. When I accepted pain and hardship as part of life, I realized that happiness wasn't just about feeling good all the time. And when I looked at my darkest parts, I was able to bring them into the light and grow from them.

The biggest paradox of all, though, is the one at the end of the Reflection. The only way to keep the gifts of the program is to pass them on. It seems counterintuitive - shouldn't I keep these gifts for myself? But that's not how it works. When I share my experience, strength, and hope with others in the Fellowship, I am reminded of the gifts I've been given. And when I see others growing and changing because of the program, I am strengthened in my own recovery.

It's all so mysterious and paradoxical, but it makes sense in a way that defies logic. And that's one of the things I love about the program of AA. It's not a program that you can figure out with your head - you have to feel it in your heart. And when you do, it can change your life in ways you never thought possible.

> Here is the reflection for 24.02 A THANKFUL HEART February 24 I try to hold fast to the truth that a full and thankful heart cannot entertain great conceits. When brimming with gratitude, one's heartbeat must surely result in outgoing love, the finest emotion that we can ever know. AS BILL SEES IT, p. 37 My sponsor told me that I should be a grateful alcoholic and always have "an attitude of gratitude"â€”that gratitude was the basic ingredient of humility, that humility was the basic ingredient of anonymity and that "anonymity was the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities." As a result of this guidance, I start every morning on my knees, thanking God for three things: I'm alive, I'm sober, and I'm a member of Alcoholics Anonymous. Then I try to live an "attitude of gratitude" and thoroughly enjoy another twenty-four hours of the A.A. way of life. A.A. is not something I joined; it's something I live. Can you give me some ideas for today's share?

2.  The power of gratitude: Reflect on the power of gratitude to transform your life. Share some of the ways in which cultivating a thankful heart has helped you to stay humble, connected to others, and focused on what's really important in life. You could also discuss some of the scientific research on gratitude and its benefits for mental health and well-being.
    
3.  Living an "attitude of gratitude": Talk about what it means to live with an "attitude of gratitude." How do you practice gratitude in your daily life? What are some of the challenges you've faced in staying grateful, and how have you overcome them?

Having an "attitude of gratitude" means having a mindset of appreciation and thankfulness for the things we have in our lives, rather than focusing on what we lack. It involves acknowledging the good things in our lives and feeling grateful for them, even if they seem small or insignificant.

Living with an attitude of gratitude means consciously looking for things to be grateful for, and taking the time to appreciate and savor them. This could involve keeping a gratitude journal, where you write down a few things each day that you're grateful for, or simply taking a moment each morning or evening to reflect on what you're thankful for in your life.

There are many ways to practice gratitude in your daily life. Some examples might include:

*   Saying "thank you" to others whenever they do something kind or helpful.
*   Focusing on the present moment and appreciating the beauty of the world around you, whether it's a beautiful sunset or the sound of birds singing.
*   Practicing mindfulness meditation, which can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, and cultivate a sense of gratitude for the present moment.
*   Volunteering or giving back to others in some way, which can help you feel grateful for the opportunity to make a positive difference in the world.

Of course, there are also challenges to staying grateful. It can be easy to get caught up in negative thoughts or to take the good things in our lives for granted. One way to overcome these challenges is to actively practice gratitude, even when it doesn't come naturally. This could involve making a conscious effort to focus on the good things in your life, even when things are tough.

Another way to stay grateful is to cultivate a sense of perspective. When we're feeling down or discouraged, it can be helpful to remind ourselves of all the things we have to be thankful for. This might involve taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, or talking to someone we trust who can help us see things from a different perspective.

Ultimately, living with an attitude of gratitude is a practice that takes time and effort. But by making a conscious effort to focus on the good things in our lives, we can cultivate a sense of joy and appreciation that can help us stay grounded and resilient, even in the face of challenges.

> What is the current state of research on the physiological effects of practising gratitude? Have I heard something about the effects on the Vagus nerve?
> 
> 1 / 1

There has been a growing body of research on the physiological effects of practicing gratitude, and some studies have suggested that gratitude can have positive effects on the nervous system, including the vagus nerve.

The vagus nerve is one of the longest nerves in the body and is responsible for controlling a range of functions in the body, including heart rate, digestion, and immune function. Studies have suggested that the vagus nerve plays an important role in regulating the body's stress response and promoting feelings of calm and relaxation.

Research has shown that practicing gratitude can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the branch of the nervous system responsible for promoting rest and relaxation. This, in turn, can stimulate the vagus nerve and promote feelings of calm and well-being.

In a study published in the journal Psychological Science, researchers found that participants who were asked to write letters expressing gratitude experienced greater feelings of well-being and more positive emotions, compared to participants who wrote about neutral or negative events. These participants also showed greater activation of the vagus nerve, suggesting that gratitude may have a physiological effect on the body.

Other studies have suggested that practicing gratitude can have a range of other physiological benefits, including reducing inflammation, improving sleep quality, and boosting the immune system.

While more research is needed to fully understand the physiological effects of practicing gratitude, the evidence so far suggests that there may be a link between gratitude and improved health and well-being.
