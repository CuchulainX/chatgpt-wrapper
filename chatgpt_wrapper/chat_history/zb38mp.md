Model: Default (GPT-3.5)

> I need to change the block of code below, to instead use the dictionary generated by: sql\_query = text(""" SELECT tracks.release\_id, tracks.track\_id, tracks.duration, tracks.last\_mod, tracks.track\_number, tracks.title, tracks.duration\_enc FROM hub.temp\_beat\_tracks\_2023\_03 AS tracks """) track\_data\_from\_temp\_table = self.session.execute(sql\_query).fetchall() for t in response\_dict\["product\_state"\]\["product"\]\["tracks"\]: duration\_in\_seconds = isodate.parse\_duration( t\["duration"\] ).seconds track = Track() track.track\_id = t\["ids"\]\["\_id"\] track.duration = duration\_in\_seconds track.title = t\["title"\] track.track\_number = t\["track\_number"\] track.book\_id = book.id track.duration\_enc = t\["duration"\] audiobook\_length += int(duration\_in\_seconds)

To use the dictionary generated by the SQL query, you can replace the loop that iterates over the response\_dict\["product\_state"\]\["product"\]\["tracks"\] with a loop that iterates over track\_data\_from\_temp\_table.

Here's an updated code block that uses the dictionary generated by the SQL query instead of the response\_dict:

python

```python
sql_query = text("""
    SELECT  tracks.release_id,
            tracks.track_id,
            tracks.duration,
            tracks.last_mod,
            tracks.track_number,
            tracks.title,
            tracks.duration_enc
    FROM hub.temp_beat_tracks_2023_03 AS tracks
""")
track_data_from_temp_table = self.session.execute(sql_query).fetchall()

for track_data in track_data_from_temp_table:
    duration_in_seconds = isodate.parse_duration(track_data.duration).seconds

    track = Track()
    track.track_id = track_data.track_id
    track.duration = duration_in_seconds
    track.title = track_data.title
    track.track_number = track_data.track_number
    track.book_id = book.id
    track.duration_enc = track_data.duration_enc

    audiobook_length += int(duration_in_seconds)
```

Note that in the updated code, we are using the duration and duration\_enc fields from the track\_data dictionary to set the duration of the track. The isodate.parse\_duration() function is no longer needed, since the duration is already in the correct format. Also, we are setting the track\_id field of the Track object to track\_data.track\_id, which is the track ID from the SQL query result.
