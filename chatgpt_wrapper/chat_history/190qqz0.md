> 1 / 1

Keeping a running list of accomplishments can be a helpful way to stay organized and ensure that you don't forget any of your achievements. Here are some tips for maintaining an effective running list:

1.  Keep it up-to-date: Set aside time regularly, such as once a month, to review and update your list. This will ensure that you capture all of your recent accomplishments while they are still fresh in your mind.
    
2.  Be specific: When you add an accomplishment to your list, be sure to include as many specific details as possible. This will make it easier to reference later when you need to highlight your achievements to a potential employer.
    
3.  Use metrics: Whenever possible, include specific metrics or numbers to quantify your accomplishments. For example, if you increased sales for your company, include the percentage or dollar amount of the increase.
    
4.  Focus on outcomes: When describing your accomplishments, focus on the outcomes or results you achieved rather than just the tasks you completed. This will help potential employers understand the impact you had on your previous organization.
    
5.  Customize your list: Consider creating separate lists of accomplishments for different types of roles or industries. This will allow you to highlight the most relevant accomplishments for each job you apply to.
    
6.  Include both small and large accomplishments: Don't only focus on major achievements like promotions or awards. Also, include smaller accomplishments that demonstrate your skills and work ethic, such as successfully completing a difficult project or receiving positive feedback from a client.
    

By following these tips, you can create a comprehensive and useful running list of accomplishments that will help you stand out in your job search.

> What does Google refer to their method of quantifying achievements as?
> 
> 1 / 1

Google refers to their method of quantifying achievements as "STAR" stories. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. In a STAR story, the candidate describes a situation they faced, the task they were assigned, the action they took to complete the task, and the result or outcome of their work. The goal of using STAR stories is to provide specific and concrete examples of the candidate's skills and accomplishments, using quantifiable metrics whenever possible. This method allows recruiters and hiring managers to evaluate candidates based on their past performance and potential for future success in the role they are applying for.
