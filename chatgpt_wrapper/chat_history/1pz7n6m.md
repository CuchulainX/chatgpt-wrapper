Django Cookiecutter is a project template for Django web applications that follows best practices and includes several popular tools and configurations out of the box. However, Django Cookiecutter itself does not provide a direct way to generate template pages from the models file.

To generate template pages, views, and other files automatically from your Django models, you can use Django's built-in functionality or third-party packages. One popular option is Django's built-in `ModelForm` which allows you to create forms based on your models. You can use these forms in your views and templates to display and process the data. To create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, you can use Django's generic class-based views like `CreateView`, `UpdateView`, `DeleteView`, and `DetailView`.

If you're looking for a more automatic solution to generate template pages from your models, consider using third-party packages like:

1.  Django CRUD Generator: This package can generate views, forms, and templates for your Django models. You can find it here: [https://github.com/lucasrangit/django-crud-generator](https://github.com/lucasrangit/django-crud-generator)
2.  Django Builder: An online tool that helps you generate models, views, forms, and templates for your Django application. Visit: [https://djangobuilder.io/](https://djangobuilder.io/)

Remember that these third-party tools are not directly related to Django Cookiecutter, and you'll need to integrate them into your Django Cookiecutter project.
