Sure, I'd be happy to explain how Notion databases work.

Notion databases are a powerful way to organize and manage information in Notion. They are similar to traditional spreadsheets or tables, but they offer much more functionality and flexibility.

In a Notion database, you can create columns to store different types of information. For example, you might create a column for the name of an item, another column for the price, and another column for the quantity.

Once you've created your columns, you can start adding items to the database. Each row in the database represents an individual item, and each column contains a different piece of information about that item.

You can then use filters, sorting, and grouping to organize and manipulate the data in the database. For example, you might filter the database to show only items that are in stock or sort the database by price to see the most expensive items at the top.

Notion databases also allow you to link to other pages and databases within Notion, creating a powerful interconnected system of information. This means you can easily reference other information in your database, such as related tasks, projects, or notes.

Overall, Notion databases offer a flexible and powerful way to organize and manage information, making them a popular tool for individuals, teams, and organizations.
