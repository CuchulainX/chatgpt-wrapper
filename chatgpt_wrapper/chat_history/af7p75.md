Model: Default (GPT-3.5)

> Read these User Stories and generate the Django Models required for them. Then provide a Python script that will load each user stories into the Django App. User Stories: 1. As a job seeker, I want to easily search for job openings based on my preferred location, industry, and job title, so that I can find the perfect job opportunity. 2. As a recruiter, I want to create a company profile and post job openings, so that I can attract suitable candidates for my job openings. 3. As a job seeker, I want to create a professional-looking resume in minutes using the built-in resume builder tool, so that I can stand out from other job seekers. 4. As a job seeker, I want to access resources and tips to help me prepare for interviews, so that I can increase my chances of getting hired. 5. As a job seeker, I want to access career development resources such as articles and videos on professional development and skills training, so that I can advance my career.

Django Models:

python

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class JobSeeker(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    resume = models.FileField(upload_to='resumes/')
    location = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    industry = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    job_title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Company(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    industry = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    industry = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()

class Resource(models.Model):
    CATEGORY_CHOICES = [
        ('interview', 'Interview Preparation'),
        ('career', 'Career Development'),
    ]
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    category = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=CATEGORY_CHOICES)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

Python script to load User Stories:

Here's the continuation of the Python script to load the User Stories into the Django App:

python

```python
from django.core.management import BaseCommand
from app.models import JobSeeker, Company, JobOpening, Resource

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = "Load user stories data into the Django app"

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        user_stories = [
            "As a job seeker, I want to easily search for job openings based on my preferred location, industry, and job title, so that I can find the perfect job opportunity.",
            "As a recruiter, I want to create a company profile and post job openings, so that I can attract suitable candidates for my job openings.",
            "As a job seeker, I want to create a professional-looking resume in minutes using the built-in resume builder tool, so that I can stand out from other job seekers.",
            "As a job seeker, I want to access resources and tips to help me prepare for interviews, so that I can increase my chances of getting hired.",
            "As a job seeker, I want to access career development resources such as articles and videos on professional development and skills training, so that I can advance my career."
        ]

        for story in user_stories:
            resource = Resource(title=f"User Story {user_stories.index(story) + 1}", content=story, category="user_story")
            resource.save()

        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS("Successfully loaded user stories into the Django app"))
```

To use this script, create a custom management command by following these steps:

1.  In your Django app directory, create a folder named `management` and a subfolder named `commands` inside it.
2.  Save the script in a file named `load_user_stories.py` inside the `commands` folder.
3.  Run the custom management command with `python manage.py load_user_stories`. This will load the user stories into the `Resource` model.

> All the above was great, nicely done. But what I had in mind was a more simpler structure in which to store the user stories which can be referred to during forward and reverse engineering cycles of the Django app. features being developed for the app are stored (Epic, User Story, Feature, Issue, Tasks) a manner of tracking the status (Backlog, Enriching, To Do, Doing, Done, etc)
> 
> 1 / 1

I apologize for the misunderstanding. Based on your request, here's a simpler structure to store the user stories and track their status during development cycles:

Django Models:

python

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Epic(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()

class UserStory(models.Model):
    epic = models.ForeignKey(Epic, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.TextField()

class Feature(models.Model):
    user_story = models.ForeignKey(UserStory, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    description = models.TextField()

class Issue(models.Model):
    feature = models.ForeignKey(Feature, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    description = models.TextField()

class Task(models.Model):
    issue = models.ForeignKey(Issue, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    description = models.TextField()

class Status(models.Model):
    STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('backlog', 'Backlog'),
        ('enriching', 'Enriching'),
        ('todo', 'To Do'),
        ('doing', 'Doing'),
        ('done', 'Done'),
    ]
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)

class ItemStatus(models.Model):
    item_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    item_id = models.IntegerField()
    status = models.ForeignKey(Status, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

Python script to load User Stories:

1 / 1

> I'd prefer is these were modeled into a simpler Feature model and a feature\_type column could reference a tables containing (Epic, User Story, Feature, Issue, Task) and further reference to a stataus table
> 
> 1 / 1

Based on your preference, I have modified the Django models to have a simpler structure:

Django Models:

python

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class FeatureType(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class Status(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class Feature(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    feature_type = models.ForeignKey(FeatureType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    status = models.ForeignKey(Status, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    parent = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

The `FeatureType` model will store the types (Epic, User Story, Feature, Issue, Task), and the `Status` model will store the various status options (Backlog, Enriching, To Do, Doing, Done, etc). The `Feature` model is now a simpler, more generic model that can represent any of the types you mentioned, with a `feature_type` column referencing the corresponding type and a `status` column for the status. The `parent` field allows features to be hierarchically related to each other, so you can represent the relationships between Epics, User Stories, Features, Issues, and Tasks.

1 / 1

> Can you enrich Feature to include some start and end dates, and the following space separated list of columns: Author Complexity ObjectType Parent Date Added ParentPackage Phase Priority Status Stereotype Version Language Keywords Difficulty Alias Visibility.
> 
> 1 / 1

Here's the `Feature` model enriched with the additional fields you requested:

python

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class FeatureType(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class Status(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class Feature(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField()
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    complexity = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    object_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    parent = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    parent_package = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)
    phase = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    priority = models.IntegerField()
    status = models.ForeignKey(Status, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    stereotype = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    version = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    language = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    keywords = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    difficulty = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    alias = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)
    visibility = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    feature_type = models.ForeignKey(FeatureType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

The `Feature` model now includes start and end dates, as well as additional columns based on the provided list. Note that I have set some fields to `null=True` and `blank=True` to allow for optional fields. You can adjust these according to your requirements.

1 / 1

> Now, can you provide a Python script to load our original User Stories into the new Model?
> 
> 1 / 1

Here's a Python script to load the original User Stories into the new `Feature` model:

python

```python
from django.core.management import BaseCommand
from app.models import Feature, FeatureType, Status, User

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = "Load user stories data into the Django app"

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        user_stories = [
            "As a job seeker, I want to easily search for job openings based on my preferred location, industry, and job title, so that I can find the perfect job opportunity.",
            "As a recruiter, I want to create a company profile and post job openings, so that I can attract suitable candidates for my job openings.",
            "As a job seeker, I want to create a professional-looking resume in minutes using the built-in resume builder tool, so that I can stand out from other job seekers.",
            "As a job seeker, I want to access resources and tips to help me prepare for interviews, so that I can increase my chances of getting hired.",
            "As a job seeker, I want to access career development resources such as articles and videos on professional development and skills training, so that I can advance my career."
        ]

        # Create a FeatureType for User Stories
        user_story_type, created = FeatureType.objects.get_or_create(name="User Story")

        # Create a Status for Backlog
        backlog_status, created = Status.objects.get_or_create(name="Backlog")

        # Assuming the first user in the User model is the author
        author = User.objects.first()

        for story in user_stories:
            feature = Feature(
                title=f"User Story {user_stories.index(story) + 1}",
                description=story,
                feature_type=user_story_type,
                status=backlog_status,
                author=author,
                complexity="",
                object_type="",
                phase="",
                priority=1,
                stereotype="",
                version="",
                language="",
                difficulty="",
                visibility=""
            )
            feature.save()

        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS("Successfully loaded user stories into the Django app"))
```

To use this script, create a custom management command by following these steps:

1.  In your Django app directory, create a folder named `management` and a subfolder named `commands` inside it.
2.  Save the script in a file named `load_user_stories.py` inside the `commands` folder.
3.  Run the custom management command with `python manage.py load_user_stories`. This will load the user stories into the `Feature` model as User Stories with the "Backlog" status.

Remember to adjust the author variable as needed, since I assumed that the first user in the User model is the author in this example.

The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model

Sorry about that, here's the complete Django model for the provided SQL DDL:

python

```python

    author = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    version = models.CharField(max_length=50, default='1.0', null=True, blank=True)
    note = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
    package_id = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    stereotype = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)

    effort = models.IntegerField(default=0, null=True, blank=True)
    created_date = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    modified_date = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=50, null=True, blank=True)

    parent_id = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)

    class Meta:
        db_table = 't_object'
```

The `TObject` model has fields corresponding to the columns in the SQL DDL. Note that some fields are set to `null=True` and `blank=True` to allow for optional fields, such as `note` and `parent_id`. The `ea_guid` field is marked as unique since it appears to be a primary key in the original data model. The `Meta` class specifies the database table name as `t_object`.

The `TObjectRequires` model has fields corresponding to the columns in the SQL DDL. The `object` field is a foreign key to the `TObject` model, with a `CASCADE` on delete behavior, meaning that if a `TObject` record is deleted, all associated `TObjectRequires` records will also be deleted.

    object = models.ForeignKey(TObject, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        db_table = 't_attribute'
```

The `TAttribute` model has fields corresponding to the columns in the SQL DDL. The `object` field is a foreign key to the `TObject` model, with a `CASCADE` on delete behavior, meaning that if a `TObject` record is deleted, all associated `TAttribute` records will also be deleted. The `Meta` class specifies the database table name as `t_attribute`.

It looks like you have provided a list of tables and the reasoning behind their creation. It seems like these tables are related to a system for managing job applications, candidates, and job postings. The tables capture information about candidates, job postings, interviews, tasks, and other related objects.

Each table has columns that correspond to specific attributes or properties of the objects they represent. For example, the `user_skills` table has columns that allow users to associate skills with other objects, and the `job_posts` table has columns that allow users to manage job postings.

The tables appear to support a variety of user stories related to managing job applications and related data, including adding/editing address information, tracking communication related to job applications, and managing reminders and notifications related to tasks and applications.

You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you in building the database. If you have any further questions or need any additional help, don't hesitate to ask.

> I want you to create a Django model called EATModelTables to store them and then create a script to load them.
> 
> 1 / 1

Sure, here's an example Django model called `EATModelTables` that can be used to store the tables you listed:

python

```python
from django.db import models

class EATModelTables(models.Model):
    table_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    reason_for_creation = models.TextField()
    user_stories_supported = models.TextField()
```

To load the data into this model, you can create a script that reads in the data from a CSV file and creates instances of the `EATModelTables` model for each row. Here's an example script that assumes the data is in a file called `eat_data.csv`:

python

```python
import csv
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from yourapp.models import EATModelTables

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Loads EAT model tables data from CSV file'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        with open('eat_data.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
            for row in reader:
                table = EATModelTables()
                table.table_name = row['Table Name']
                table.reason_for_creation = row['Reason for Creation']
                table.user_stories_supported = row['User Stories Supported']
                table.save()
```

You can then run this script using the Django management command `python manage.py load_eat_data`. Make sure to replace `yourapp` with the name of your Django app that contains the `EATModelTables` model.

1 / 1

> where should load\_eat\_data.py be saved to to make it available to manage.py
> 
> 1 / 1

You can save the `load_eat_data.py` script in the same directory as the `manage.py` file. Alternatively, you can create a new directory named "scripts" (or any other name you prefer) in your Django project's root directory and save the script there. Then, to run the script, you can use the following command:

`python manage.py runscript scripts.load_eat_data`

This assumes that the script file is named `load_eat_data.py` and it's saved in the `scripts` directory. You can adjust the path as needed to reflect the actual location of the script file.
