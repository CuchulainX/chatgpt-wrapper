Here's a technical note about it: TN0073: Extending WinWrap® Basic with VB Collection Fails Tech Note TN0073 (9/13/97) Question I just noticed something; the following code used to work in VB: Dim c As New Collection Dim b As Boolean b = BasicIdeCtl1.AddExtension(""~"", c) b is still returning as True, but WinWrap® Basic does give an ""object is Nothing"" error whenever I use New Collection in my WinWrap® Basic code. The last time I used this in macro code (and it worked) was some time ago (a couple of months); before porting to VB5. That is, I know it worked in VB4-32, but I can't say I know when it broke: in VB5, or due to a WinWrap® Basic update, or even due to the VB5 SP2. What is going on? Answer VB5 doesn't let WinWrap® Basic create collection objects at run time like VB4 does. Assuming the Collection type has been added, the following code doesn't work under VB5 even with the AddExtension: Sub Main Dim C As Collection Set C = New Collection End Sub The Set line fails because the Collection type implemented by VB5 refuses to create an instance. I guess the VB guys decided to stick it to us. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. With VB5 you can create a class called Collection which is merely a proxy for a VB5 Collection. The Menu sample implements just such a class.",> 1 / 1

See here for details: https://jira4skoobe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/3346726913/Production+database+servers I’ll give you access rights on separate channels. Regarding the new production database servers, I ordered the second one today and changed my mind regarding configuration a bit. The primary server has now a whopping 320 GB of RAM + 3.84 TB of raid 1 SSD for mysql data + 960 GB raid 1 SSD for binary logs (probably overkill). The replica or secondary has 256 GB of RAM, 3.84 TB raid 1 SSD + 16 TB raid 1 HD for backups. So backups will be done against the replica, which is better anyway. The replica will also serve as a RO instance for reports and stats. Will write this up in https://jira4skoobe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/3346726913/Production+database+servers October 11th, 2022 Second server is configured.

Same credentials as for the first configured server: https://jira4skoobe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/3346726913/Production+database+servers secondary raid on both servers created, this concludes the initial setup. will add a setup description for manual raid configuration to the docs..

In general, Hazelcast supports backwards compatibility between minor releases, which means that a newer server version should be able to communicate with an older client version. However, there could be compatibility issues if there are significant changes in the protocol or APIs between the two versions."

These platforms enable users to access digital content such as books, images, videos, or music from a variety of publishers or creators, often for a fee or subscription. The platform serves as an intermediary between the content creators and consumers, providing a centralized marketplace for buying, selling, and distributing digital content. Examples of such platforms include Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, Shutterstock for stock images, and YouTube for user-generated videos. The revenue model for these platforms often involves taking a percentage of the sale or subscription revenue generated by the content, and then distributing the remaining revenue to the content creators based on consumption or usage metrics."

The solution I was thinking of was a custom python script that would ingest each class and it's definition from models.py and store it in a python dictionary perhaps.

1xy3mik.md,Default (GPT-3.5),193,"1\. Companies contact recruitment agencies to hire on their behalf. In some cases, companies recruit employees directly. 2. The person responsible for recruitment starts the recruiting process. This process can have multiple steps, such as the initial screening, a written test, the first interview, the follow-up interview, the actual hiring decision, etc. 3. Once the recruiters have agreed on a particular process – and this can change depending on the client, the company, or the job in question – the vacancy is advertised on various platforms. # Process The process category contains information related to the recruiting processes. It contains three tables: \`process\`, \`step\`, and \`process\_step\`. We’ll look at each one. The \`process\` table stores information about each recruitment process. Every process will have a special id, a code, and a \`description\` of that process. We’ll also have the \`recruiter\_id\` of the person who initiates the process. The \`step\` table contains information about the steps followed throughout that recruitment process. Every step has an \`id\` and a \`code\` name. The name column can have values like “initial screening”, “written test”, “HR interview”, etc. Since one process can have multiple steps and one step can be part of many processes, we need a lookup table. The \`process\_step\` table contains information about each step (in \`step\_id\`) and the process it belongs to (in \`process\_id\`). We also have a status, which tells us the status of that step in that process; this can be NULL if the step hasn’t been started yet. Finally, we have a \`priority\`, which tells us which order to execute the steps in. The steps with the highest \`priority\` value will be executed first.

Too many times discouragement has been the bonus for unrealistic expectations, not to mention self-pity or fatigue from my wanting to change the world by the weekend. Discouragement is a warning signal that I may have wandered across the God line. The secret of fulfilling my potential is in acknowledging my limitations and believing that time is a gift, not a threat. Hope is the key that unlocks the door of discouragement. The program promises me that if I do not pick up the first drink today, I will always have hope. Having come to believe that I keep what I share, every time I encourage, I receive courage. It is with others that, with the grace of God and the Fellowship of A.A., I trudge the road of happy destiny. May I always remember that the power within me is far greater than any fear before me.

We will charge a percentage of the candidate's salary as our fee, which will vary depending on the level of the role and the experience of the candidate. We may also offer additional services such as job posting and candidate screening for a fee. We anticipate that our revenue will grow rapidly as we establish our brand and build our client base. Our cost structure will be focused on salaries, marketing, and office overheads. We anticipate that our profitability will increase as we scale the business and achieve economies of scale. Comprehensive outline of our expected eventual revenue streams, with 1 and 3 forming our initial offering in the launch phase: 1. Permanent Placement: We receive a one-time fee for placing a candidate with a company. Typically between 10% and 20% of the candidates total first year salary. 2. Contract Staffing: provide temporary staff to clients on a contract basis. We charge a fee based on the hourly or daily rate of the candidate. 3. Executive Search: We find and place senior-level executives in a company. Executive search fees are typically higher than permanent placement fees. 4. Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO): we take on the entire recruitment process for a client, including sourcing, screening, and selecting candidates. We charge a fee based on the number of hires made. 5. Managed Services: we provide full hiring services to clients, such as talent acquisition, onboarding, and workforce planning. We charge a fee based on services provided. 6. Consulting Services: We offer consulting services to clients on talent strategy, market insights, growth strategies, and recruitment best practices. We charge a fee based on the scope of the consulting engagement. 7. As we become more tech-driven and build out our own AI toolset, we can offer skills assessment and other smart screening services to our clients.",> 1 / 1

But there is a better way! which is to environment specific folders (as @Arndt Jenssen suggested initially). So now there is a new structure in the repo. A common directory which has a base configuration, and then branch specific overrides. I think this will actually be easier. I was finding it kind of a pain to get the other system correct without accidentally mixing up different environment configurations when merging and copying etc. also, it looks like we have changed the name of staging environment to stg , instead of staging is thios right @Arndt Jenssen? This could cause problems in a few places potentially. just something to look out for if that is the case. Yup, I went for short names.. But since dev environment names should come exclusively from consul - this should be fine .. sure. its just some services have checkis like if $ENVIRONMENT== ""staging"": … sort of things that we need to look out for bad practise anyway, should be descriptive like $ENABLE\_X or whatever.. yeah for sure.

I want to add this key, adressed via nomad templating to the repo: {{ key ""skoobe/configuration/account/file-conf"" }} How would you do that? (and its a multiline value as well) (and please forget the dev prefix in my first question) make a file /consul/common/configuration/account.json and then have {""file-conf"": ""$VALUE""} in the file then if the value is different between environments then add /consul/${BRANCH}/configuration/account.json files also with different values I mean /consul/${ENVIRONMENT}/configuration/account.json not sure how the multi-lineness affects things though. might just have to test that out.

The primary server has now a whopping 320 GB of RAM + 3.84 TB of raid 1 SSD for mysql data + 960 GB raid 1 SSD for binary logs (probably overkill). The replica or secondary has 256 GB of RAM, 3.84 TB raid 1 SSD + 16 TB raid 1 HD for backups. So backups will be done against the replica, which is better anyway. The replica will also serve as a RO instance for reports and stats.
